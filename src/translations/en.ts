The project aims to digitize the ticketing process by replacing physical tickets with facial recognition access, allowing match-goers to link their facial identity to their ticket for seamless and secure stadium entry.

                              Presented during the Deep Emersion Challenge at the Private University of Fes, the project earned 2nd place for its innovative use of AI and system design.

                              Built with Spring Boot (backend), MySQL (database), React and Android (frontends), and an AI engine in Python (FastAPI) using FAISS for efficient facial identity retrieval. The entire system is containerized with Docker for portability and scalability.`,
